# Year_12_Major_Project
 Major Project for the Year 12 HSC Software Design and Development Course

 A voice recording application designed for students to record their 
 understanding of topics learned in class in their own words so as to be retrieved later
 for exam revision.

The repository contains the source code, but since the application relies on various
libraries, the best way to run the project is by opening the executable
located in the ZIP file.
