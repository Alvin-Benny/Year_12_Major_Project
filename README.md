# Year_12_Major_Project
 Major Project for the Year 12 HSC Software Design and Development Course

 A voice recording appplications designed for students to record their 
 understanding of topics learned in class in their own words.

 The python files are the source code, but since the application relies on various
 libraries, the best way to use the application is by opening the executable
 located in the ZIP file.
